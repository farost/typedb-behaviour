Feature: Connection Database

  Background:
    Given typedb starts
    Given connection opens with default authentication
    Given connection is open: true
    Given connection has 0 databases

  Scenario Outline: create one database with name <name>
    When connection create database: <name>
    Then connection has database: <name>
    Examples:
      | name                                                                  |

  Scenario: create many databases
    When connection create databases:
      | alice   |
      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

    Then connection has databases:
      | alice   |
      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

  Scenario: create many databases in parallel
    When connection create databases in parallel:
      | alice   |
      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

    Then connection has databases:

      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

  Scenario: cannot create database with an incorrect name
    Then connection create database with empty name; fails
    Then connection create database: .; fails
    Then connection create database: !; fails
    Then connection create database: ...; fails
    Then connection create database: Â·â€¿Â·; fails

    # TODO: Merge it with the regular "cannot create database with an incorrect name" after fixing https://github.com/typedb/typedb-driver/issues/699

  Scenario: cannot create database with an emoji
    Then connection create database: ðŸ˜Ž; fails
    Then connection create database: myðŸ˜Ždatabase; fails

  Scenario: delete one database
    Given connection create database: alice
    When connection delete database: alice
    Then connection does not have database: alice
    Then connection has 0 databases

  Scenario: connection can delete many databases
    Given connection create databases:
      | alice   |
      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |

      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

    Then connection does not have databases:
      | alice   |
      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

    Then connection has 0 databases

  Scenario: delete many databases in parallel

      | bob     |
      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |

      | charlie |
      | dylan   |
      | eve     |
      | frank   |

    Then connection has 0 databases

  Scenario: create delete and recreate a database
    When connection create database: alice
    Then connection has database: alice
    When connection delete database: alice
    Then connection does not have database: alice
    When connection create database: alice
    Then connection has database: alice

  Scenario: delete a nonexistent database fails
    When connection delete database: typedb; fails

  Scenario: database cannot be deleted if it has open transactions
    When connection create database: typedb
    Then connection has database: typedb
    When connection open schema transaction for database: typedb
    Then transaction is open: true
